# Online Generative AI LLM Evaluation: NLP Analysis

## 📍 Project Overview

**GenAI-LLM Evalution** is a research aiming to assess the clinical accuracy, relevance, bias, and cultural appropriateness of LLM-generated cancer screening information tailored to diverse groups of users.

## 🧠 Methodological Highlights

- Integrating LLM-powered NLP using OpenAI's large NLP model thorugh its application programming interface (API).
- Use of chatbot-generated content across different platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, CoPilot, Gemini) 

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `data/`: Placeholder or linked directory for de-identified data (if publicly shareable)
- `code/`: Scripts used for text preprocessing, topic modeling, and qualitative clustering
- `docs/`: Project summary documents, plain-language explanations, and IRB-approved protocols (as shareable)
- `README.md`: This file

## 🌎 Intended Impact

This work explores the landscape of publicly available health information in the era of generative AI, with mental health therapy ranked as gen AI language models' top use case and healthy living among the top ten in 2025.[1] We also assess the potential for integrating gen AI into broader healthcare contexts.
